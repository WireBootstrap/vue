# WireBootstrap for React
Vue.js is an approachable, performant and versatile framework for building web user interfaces.

**WireBootstrap for Vue.js** features a Vue Directive that allows any WireBootstrap component to be used inside the Vue.js framework.  With this component, there is no need for WireBootstrap component authors to create a separate Vue.js version of their component.  

The solution also contains a sample project that illustrates how to use WireBootstrap in Vue.js applications.  This includes setting up access to data services using WireBootstrap data structures as well as the different ways in which the WireBootstrap Vue Directive can be used with these data services.
